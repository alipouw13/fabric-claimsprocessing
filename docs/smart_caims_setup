# Compute
* Multi-task workflow requires a MLRuntime
* DLT requires a large memory optimized cluster
* DBRuntime Compatibility
* Libraries installed

# Data
* Dataset is included in the repo
* It is copied to dbfs into /tmp folder
* When the data ingested, the data location is user specific path to aallow mutiple users to demo simultaneously
* ML model is packaged and available in the repo
* It will be lloaded into the model registry for inferecing
