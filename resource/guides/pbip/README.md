# PBIP Scaffold

This folder is a placeholder for a Power BI Project (PBIP) structure. Add exported Power BI report files here if using the PBIP authoring model.

Suggested structure:
- ReportName/ReportName.pbir
- ReportName/definition/ (JSON model definition exported)
- Dataset/ (if separated)

Currently only documentation scaffold is provided; export your .pbix as PBIP from Power BI Desktop (Preview) and place contents here.
